# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts house prices using linear regression. This project includes data generation, model training, evaluation, and a beautiful web interface for making predictions.

## 📚 What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (house features) using a linear equation:

**y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ**

Where:
- **y** = predicted house price
- **β₀** = intercept (base price)
- **βᵢ** = coefficients for each feature
- **xᵢ** = house features (square feet, bedrooms, etc.)

## 🎯 Features

- **Data Generation**: Synthetic house data with realistic features
- **Feature Engineering**: 7 key house characteristics
- **Model Training**: Linear regression with scikit-learn
- **Data Scaling**: StandardScaler for optimal performance
- **Model Evaluation**: Multiple metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding which factors matter most
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful Flask app for easy predictions
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models

## 🏗️ House Features Used

1. **Square Feet** - Total living area
2. **Bedrooms** - Number of bedrooms (1-5)
3. **Bathrooms** - Number of bathrooms (1-4)
4. **Age** - House age in years (0-50)
5. **Distance to City** - Miles from city center (0-50)
6. **Crime Rate** - Area crime rate (0-100, lower is better)
7. **School Rating** - Local school quality (1-10, higher is better)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Model

1. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python house_price_model.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Generate 1000 sample houses
   - Train the linear regression model
   - Show training metrics
   - Save the model to `house_price_model.pkl`
   - Display visualizations

2. **Start the web interface:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 📊 Model performance

The model typically achieves:
- **R² Score**: 0.85+ (85%+ variance explained)
- **RMSE**: $20,000-30,000
- **MAE**: $15,000-25,000

## 🔍 Understanding the Results

### Feature Importance
The model shows which features most affect house prices:
- **Square Feet**: Usually the strongest predictor
- **Location Factors**: Distance to city, crime rate
- **Quality Indicators**: School rating, age
- **Size Factors**: Bedrooms, bathrooms

### Prediction Accuracy
- **High R²**: Model explains most price variation
- **Low RMSE**: Predictions are close to actual prices
- **Residual Analysis**: Check for prediction bias

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalizes features
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Random State**: Fixed seed for reproducible results

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: LinearRegression from scikit-learn
- **Regularization**: None (basic linear regression)
- **Optimization**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

### Evaluation Metrics
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination

## 📈 Making Predictions

### Using Python
```python
from house_price_model import HousePricePredictor

# Load trained model
predictor = HousePricePredictor()
predictor.load_model()

# Predict price for a house
features = [2500, 3, 2, 10, 5, 20, 8]  # [sq_ft, beds, baths, age, dist, crime, school]
price = predictor.predict_price(features)
print(f"Predicted price: ${price:,.2f}")
```

### Using Web Interface
1. Fill in the house features
2. Click "Predict Price"
3. View the predicted price and feature summary

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Modify `generate_sample_data()` in `house_price_model.py`
2. Update feature list in `prepare_data()`
3. Retrain the model

### Using Real Data
1. Replace `generate_sample_data()` with your data loading function
2. Ensure your data has the same feature structure
3. Adjust feature names and preprocessing as needed

### Model Improvements
- **Polynomial Features**: Add squared terms for non-linear relationships
- **Regularization**: Use Ridge or Lasso regression
- **Feature Selection**: Remove less important features
- **Cross-Validation**: More robust evaluation
